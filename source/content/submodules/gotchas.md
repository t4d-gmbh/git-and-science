## Gotchas for <i class="fab fa-git"></i> Submodules

1. **Submodules Do Not Update Automatically** ‚ö†Ô∏è: {% if slide %}Submodules are not automatically updated to the latest commit.{% else %}When you clone a repository that contains submodules, the submodules are not automatically updated to the latest commit.
   You need to run `git submodule update` or use the `--recurse-submodules` option when cloning to ensure they are initialized and updated.{% endif %}

2. **Repository Resides in the `.git` Folder of the Parent Repo** üîí: The metadata for submodules is stored in the parent repository's `.git` folder.{% if page %} This means that the actual repository for the submodule is not in its own separate `.git` folder, which can lead to confusion.
   Be cautious that providing access to the `.git` folder of the parent repository provides access to history of all its submodules!{% endif %}
{% if page %}
{% endif %}
3. **Submodule Commits Are Detached** ü§î: <i class="fab fa-git"></i> submodules were designed to be pinned to a commit and not to track a branch.{% if page %} When you check out a submodule, it is in a "detached HEAD" state in most cases, meaning it is not on a branch.
   This can be confusing if you try to make changes directly in the submodule without creating a new branch first.
   :::{tip}
   You can setup a repository to track a branch with the `-b` option:
   
   ```bash
   git submodule add -b <bname> https://gitlab.com/...
   ```
   Or by navigating into the directory of an existing submodule (e.g. `mySub`) and running:
   ```bash
   git checkout bname
   git branch --set-upstream=origin/bname
   cd ../  # you leave the submodule
   git add mySub
   git commit -m "Tracking branch bname in mySub"
   ```
   :::

{% endif %}

4. **Submodule URLs Can Change** üîó: {% if slide %}You might need to update the `.gitmodules` file manually.{% else %}If the URL of a submodule repository changes, you need to update the `.gitmodules` file in the parent repository.
   Failing to do so can lead to broken links when trying to update or clone the submodule.{% endif %}

5. **Cloning with Submodules Requires Extra Steps** üõ†Ô∏è: {% if slide %}Remember to use the `--recurse-submodule` option when cloning.{% else %}When cloning a repository with submodules, you need to remember to use the `--recurse-submodules` option or run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` afterward.
   Forgetting these steps can lead to missing submodule content.{% endif %}

6. **Submodules Can Increase Complexity** üåÄ: {% if slide %}Might be confusing for newcomers.{%else%}Using submodules can add complexity to your project structure.
   If not managed properly, it can lead to confusion about which version of a submodule is being used and how it relates to the parent repository.{% endif %}
