# What are <i class="fab fa-git"></i> submodules?

A git submodule is a repository embedded inside another repository. 
It allows you to include and manage external repositories within your main project. 
This is particularly useful for incorporating third-party libraries or dependencies that are maintained separately.

:::{note}
Once a submodule is initialized and updated, it appears as a regular folder in your working directory, containing the files from the submodule's repository.
