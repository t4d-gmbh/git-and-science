{% if page %}
In this example, we will demonstrate how to use <i class="fab fa-git"></i> and GitHub<i class="fab fa-github"></i> for managing a paper review workflow.
The workflow involves multiple authors (and can include reviewers) providing feedback on a paper, and the authors incorporating the changes into the manuscript.

This can consists of the following steps:

1. **Initial Setup**: Authors create a GitHub repository {octicon}`repo` for the paper and share it with Co-authors (and reviewers).
2. **Writing/Reviewing Process**: Co-authors review and contribute to the paper, and provide feedback through issues {octicon}`issue-opened;0.8em` and pull requests {octicon}`git-pull-request;0.8em`.
3. **Prioritization**: Authors prioritize and group the feedback, create a timeline for revisions, create a milestone {octicon}`milestone;0.8em` (e.g. submission), and assign tasks to co-authors.
4. **Response**: Authors make changes to the paper, and commit the revisions to the repository.
4. **Discussion**: Co-authors, (reviewers) and authors discuss the feedback and changes through issues and pull requests.
5. **Finalization**: Authors finalize the paper based on the feedback and prepare it for submission.
