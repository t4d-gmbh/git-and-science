## Benefits of Git Submodules for Reproducibility

- **Pinning Submodules to Commits**: By pinning submodules to a specific commit, you can ensure the same version of an external library, dataset, or tool is always used, which is crucial for reproducibility in complex projects.
- **Independent Versioning**: Each submodule has its own versioning history, allowing it to be maintained separately from the parent project.
- **Flexibility**: Submodules can be easily updated or switched to different versions without affecting the rest of the project.
