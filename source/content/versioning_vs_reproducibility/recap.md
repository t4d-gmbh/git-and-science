### Bringing It All Together: Enhancing Reproducibility

To go from basic version control to full reproducibility, you need:

1. **Documentation**: Include thorough documentation into your repository using a `README.md` file or a dedicated `docs/` directory. This ensures that users can easily understand your project.
1. **Data Availability**: Publish your data! Use <i class="fab fa-git"></i> LFS for effective versioning of large datasets.
1. **Workflow Documentation**: Leverage <i class="fab fa-git"></i> submodules and automation scripts to comprehensively document the full analysis workflow, providing clarity on how to execute your project.
1. **Dependencies**: Clearly specify direct dependencies in your project. This helps users install the necessary libraries or tools to run your analysis.
1. **Transitive Dependencies**: Define isolated execution environments to manage transitive dependencies effectively, e.g., to ensure that all required packages are available without conflicts.
1. **Environment tracking**: Use isolation tools like Docker or ✨NixOS✨ to track the execution environment, guaranteeing consistency across different systems.
1. **Configuration Settings**: Declare and load configuration settings to manage parameters used in your analysis, making it easier for others to reproduce your work.
