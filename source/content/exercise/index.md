# Exercise

It certainly is easy to give advice about how one should use <i class="fab fa-git"></i> and related remote service to produce better science.

However, actually implementing such measures can be overwhelming when starting with nothing but well meant advices.

In this exercise you will explore a toy analysis of the well known [IRIS Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) that has been set-up following some of the well meant advices that you came across in this seminar.

This time we will work with <i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i> **GitLab**, so head over to the [Exemplary Analysis](https://gitlab.com/t4d-gmbh/teaching/exemplaryanalysis) Subgroup of <img src="./../../_static/T4D_logo_bw.svg" alt="T4D" width="25" height="25">'s _Teaching_ section and have a look at the `README.md` file you will find there.
