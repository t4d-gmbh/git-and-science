## Example: Paper Review on <i class="fab fa-github"></i> or <i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i>

{% if page %}
To demonstrate how <i class="fab fa-git"></i> and <i class="fab fa-github"></i> **GitHub** or <i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i> **GitLab** can be useful to manage a paper review workflow, we will use as an example a fictional paper written in LaTeX, where multiple authors (or optionally, reviewers) provide and incorporate feedback into the manuscript.

### Paper Writing Workflow on <i class="fab fa-github"></i>/<i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i>

This can consists of the following steps:
{% endif %}

The workflow would typically include the following steps:

1. **Initial Setup**: First authors create a Repository {octicon}`repo` for the paper and share it with co-authors (and reviewers).
2. **Writing/Reviewing Process**: Co-authors review, contribute to the paper, and provide feedback through issues {octicon}`issue-opened;0.8em` and pull requests {octicon}`git-pull-request;0.8em`.
3. **Prioritization**: Authors prioritize and group the feedback, set a timeline for revisions, create a milestone {octicon}`milestone;0.8em` (e.g., submission), and assign tasks to co-authors.
4. **Response**: Authors revise the paper and commit changes to the repository.
4. **Discussion**: Co-authors and first authors (and reviewers) discuss the feedback and changes through issues and pull requests.
5. **Finalization**: First authors finalize the paper based on the feedback and prepare it for submission.
