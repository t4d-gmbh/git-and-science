## Features of Git Submodules
- **Separation**: Submodules remain independent repositories, so their versioning history is separate from the parent repository.
- **Pinning**: Submodules can be pinned to specific commits, ensuring reproducibility by locking them to a particular state.
- **Updates**: Submodules can be updated independently or synchronized with the parent repository.

## Benefits of Git Submodules for Reproducibility

- **Pinning Submodules to Commits**: By pinning submodules to a specific commit, you can ensure the same version of an external library, dataset, or tool is always used, which is crucial for reproducibility in complex projects.
- **Independent Versioning**: Each submodule has its own versioning history, allowing it to be maintained separately from the parent project.
- **Flexibility**: Submodules can be easily updated or switched to different versions without affecting the rest of the project.
