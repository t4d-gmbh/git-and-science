## Features of Git Submodules
- **Separation**: Submodules remain independent repositories, so their versioning history is separate from the parent repository.
- **Pinning**: Submodules can be pinned to specific commits, ensuring reproducibility by locking them to a particular state.
- **Updates**: Submodules can be updated independently or synchronized with the parent repository.
