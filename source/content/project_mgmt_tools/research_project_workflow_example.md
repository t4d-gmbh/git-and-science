## Example: Paper Review on GitHub

A LaTeX paper review workflow example using Git and GitHub.
{% if page %}
In this example, we will demonstrate how to use Git and GitHub for managing a paper review workflow.
The workflow involves multiple authors (and can include reviewers) providing feedback on a paper, and the authors incorporating the changes into the manuscript.

### Paper Writing Workflow on Github
{% endif %}

This can consists of the following steps:

1. **Initial Setup**: Authors create a GitHub repository for the paper and share it with Co-authors (and reviewers).
2. **Review Process**: Co-authors review and contribute to the paper, and provide feedback through issues and pull requests.
3. **Author Prioritization**: Authors prioritize and group the feedback, create a timeline for revisions, create a milestone (e.g. submission), and assign tasks to co-authors.
4. **Author Response**: Authors make changes to the paper, and commit the revisions to the repository.
4. **Review Discussion**: Co-authors, (reviewers) and authors discuss the feedback and changes through issues and pull requests.
5. **Finalization**: Authors finalize the paper based on the feedback and prepare it for submission.
